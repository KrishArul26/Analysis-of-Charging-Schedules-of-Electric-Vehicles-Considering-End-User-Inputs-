<h3 align="left">Introduction
  
 <h4 align="left"> This section includes the analysis of the EV Charging data which provide by Schneider Electric from the year 2017 to 2020. Feature Engineering selection was applied such as Correlation test and PCA. After that cleaned data was analyzed based on various aspects to deduce the problems within the grid and to provide a suitable solution. For the ease of data analysis, the power consumption of the vehicle in a charging station is evenly distributed along the total time that the EV took for charging...</h4>

## 🔑 Results 
  <h3 align="left"> 1. Analysis of Year-Wise Power Consumption from 2017 to 2020</h3>
  <h4 align="left"> The analysis done  on the variation of power consumption in kilo-Watthour(kWh) against Time for all stations under analysis from 2017 to 2020. There were eleven stations involved in the analysis and further details are shown in Section III. The power consumption from 2017 has been increasing until 2019 and it saw a steady decline in the year 2020. The peak power consumption of the year 2019 and 2020 are 3090.991 kWh and 1128.401 kWh, respectively. </h4>

*	From 2017, there was a steady growth in the number of electric vehicles this resulted in more power consumption in 2019.
*	2020 power consumption was drastically low because of the travel regulation imposed due to Corona pandemic. 
*	The power consumption peaks range between 8 am and 4 pm, this might be because of working hours.
*	The power consumption is minimal for the time range, from 12 am to 7 am and from 4 pm to 11 pm reason might be, because of a smaller number of vehicles being charged in those time range. </h4>
