<h4 align="left">Introduction
  
 <h4 align="left"> This section includes the analysis of the EV Charging data which provide by Schneider Electric from the year 2017 to 2020. Feature Engineering selection was applied such as Correlation test and PCA. After that cleaned data was analyzed based on various aspects to deduce the problems within the grid and to provide a suitable solution. For the ease of data analysis, the power consumption of the vehicle in a charging station is evenly distributed along the total time that the EV took for charging...</h4>
